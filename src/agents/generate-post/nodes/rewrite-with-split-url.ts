1. The first is the main body of the post. You should NOT make any changes to the input, EXCEPT for replacing the callout URL at the bottom, with a message indicating the URL is in the reply.
You may include an emoji to indicate the URL is in the reply.
Example:
"Repo link in reply ðŸ‘‡"
or
"Video link in reply ðŸ§µ"
2. The second is the reply post. This should contain a very concise callout (e.g. 'Check out the repo here:'), and the URL.
Example:
"Checkout the repo here: https://github.com/bracesproul/langchain-ai"

Given the following post:
{POST}

Please split it into the two unique posts. Ensure the ONLY modification you make is to the callout & URL at the end of the post.`;
