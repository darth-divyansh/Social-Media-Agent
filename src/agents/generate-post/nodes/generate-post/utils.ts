Here are the relevant links used to create the report.
You should remove tracking query parameters from the link, if present.
If you are unsure whether a link's parameters are tracking, do not remove them. It's better to have a link with tracking parameters than a broken link.
The links do NOT contribute to the post's length. They are temporarily removed from the post before the length is calculated, and re-added afterwards.
