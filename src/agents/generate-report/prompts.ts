You should focus on technical details, new findings, new features, and other interesting information about the content.
These details will be used in a report generated after this, so ensure the details you extract are relevant and accurate. Do NOT make up details, or make assumptions.

You should first read the entire content carefully, then do the following:

1. Ask yourself what the content is about, and why it matters.
2. Ensure each key detail is unique from the rest of the list. You should group together similar details you find throughout the content.
3. With this in mind, think about ALL of the key details from the content. Remember: NO DETAIL IS TOO SMALL, and NO DETAIL IS TOO LARGE. It's better to overdo it than underdo it.
4. Finally, extract the key details from the content, and respond with them.

Your response should be in proper markdown format, and should ONLY include the key details from the content, and no other dialog.
Think carefully and slowly. Begin!`;

- Include any relevant links found in the content in the report. These will be useful for readers to learn more about the content.
